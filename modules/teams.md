This module is used to specify the teams used in the match and what their attributes are.
Matches without teams can be setup with the [players](/modules/players) module.

The soft player limit for each team is set with the `max=""` attribute and the hard limit with `max-overfill`. If max overfill is not explicitly defined the default will be set to 25% over the maximum team size. Players will not be able to join teams once the max overfill team size is reached.

The team's name is specified inside the `<team>` element. The name should be kept as short as possible and not contain "Team", for example, "Azure" and not "Azure Team".
A team's `plural` attribute specifies if the team name is plural, e.g. "Attackers"; PGM will use this to pick appropriate win messages, etc. The `show-name-tags` attribute specifies who can see player name tags, this only applies to players, observers will always see all name tags.

It is common for maps to only have 2 teams, although more are possible it usually just causes confusion.

       <team id="blue-team" color="blue" max="50" max-overfill="70">Blue</team>
    </teams>

The total maximum number of players in the example given above is 100, however, the max overfill will allow up to 140 players. Servers currently have a player limit of 150, so 100 players in total would allow 50 observers, or 10 observers if teams are at max overfill.
